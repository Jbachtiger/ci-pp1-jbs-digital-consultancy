  - This page will provide a short summary of each of the services we offer accompanied with a call to action button which guides them to fill out a form. 
  - Images have also been used to make the page more attractive and convey the message across throguh words as well as visually.

### Future Development

- Add a portfolio page to display testimonials and case studies.
- Add a blog page to be able to ensure the website get's consistent fresh long form content that is industry relevant and targeted to specific keywords that will help the websites SEO and gain more organic visitors.
- Make use of videos for the service page, discussing what each service is in more detail.
- Create a burger menu for mobile view - this will especially be needed when more pages are added to the menu.
- Currently the form on the contact page uses the Code Institute form dump url as I have not yet learned how to create the script needed in order to make the form function correctly without it.
- Create an email newsletter signup form.

## Testing 

The main focus of the testing is on HTML and CSS as these are the two languages that were used to create the static website. The testing carried out ensures that the functionality and visual aspects of the website all work as intended. Testing will be done using numerous devices and browsers, ensuring all UX is up to scratch as well as testing the websites accessibility, SEO and validation. I have checked the following:

- The overall website navigational experience, ensuring each page is easy to access and there is a clear and logical flow.
- All internal, outgoing and anchor elements work correctly. External links open up in a new tab.
- All forms are working as expected including script checks e.g. if a user fills in a mandatory field in a form an error message is shown, default values are being populated, optimally formatted for better readability and form is correctly linked to Code Institute form dump on submit.
- Contrast checks should report no errors.
- Validation checks for HTML and CSS should report no errors. 
- Lighthouse test scores should be high (above 90).

I have tested the website across the three major browsers - Goolge, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. For each browser, functionality was tested including links and the responsive design. The website performed as intended and the responsive design was checked using developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes. 

The official W3C Markup Validator was used to validate both the html and css of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site. The links to the results for each html page and css stylesheet is below.
