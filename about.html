                    <h2>Where it all began</h2>
                    <p>
                        I graduated with a Business Management degree in 2013 from the University of Brighton with a focus on digital marketing. Within the following years of graduating I then honed my skills by working in various
                        digital roles both agency and in-house. These roles generally included managing campaigns from inception through to completion, from small campagins to large portfolios worth £1000s.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="left-about">
                    <h2>Why start my own agency?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I realised that a common theme of what brought me enjoyment in these roles was being able to help the less digital savvy clients make a success of their digital presence and marketing activites by providing hands
                        on support and getting stuck in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As time went on, the roles I was being offered were taking me further away from this hands on techincal implementation and more into people management which is when I knew it was the right time to look into other
                        avenues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love supporting small independent businesses and being able to help and nuture their growth through marketing and website design seemed a win win. I was able to use my years experience to help the little guy and
                        gal thrive and that’s how JB's Digital Consultancy was born.

                    <h2>Adding my experience to your business</h2>
                    <p>
                        The roles I’ve had in digital marketing have exposed me to brands of all sizes within a diverse range of industries. This experience has allowed me to witness first hand an array of cultures, processes, tools and
                        a real mixer of results!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important takeaway is that I started to identify patterns of what worked and what didn't, what good marketers did and what made bad marketers as well as all sorts of different techiques which could be
                        used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This has been invaluable to shaped the way in which I work today. I like to work collaboratively, involving you in all stages of the project to ensure the solution being delivered works perfectly for your
                        specific business needs.
